- - 👋 Hi, I’m @6G-coding
  - 
- 👀 I’m fascinated by the world of AI and how it's transforming our lives. From self-driving cars to predictive healthcare, the possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to explore them all.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into the realms of neural networks and the magic of quantum computing. Every day is a new adventure in code and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make a difference—whether it's a groundbreaking AI model or an innovative open-source tool that helps the community.
- 📫 You can reach me at [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilesh-shetty/]), [Naukri.com]([https://www.naukri.com/mnjuser/]) .

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee connoisseur and I code best with a cup of freshly brewed espresso by my side. I also once trained a neural network to identify different types of coffee beans!
